Analysis of the origins of patents in the Intellectual Ventures patent portfolio
=====================================================

Intellectual Ventures (IV) made their [patent portfolio](http://patents.intven.com/finder) public (available as [csv file](http://patents.intven.com/data/ivpatents.csv)), which contains nearly 30,000 patents.

This code finds the original assignees and inventors for IV's patents, as well as other data, by looking up the patent IDs in Google's patent database. We use this metadata to ask how many of these patents were originally assigned to universities.
